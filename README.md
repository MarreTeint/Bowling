*Created by Martin, Kevin, Elyas, Bastien, and Maxime.*

# Project details
This web tool easily **calculate the score of a bowling game**. It is **easy to install and use**, and meet all the needs defined by our initial client.

# Technologies used
The project is produced using **Node JS, React, and Typescript** adding to common web languages such as HTML and CSS. The main goal behind choosing REACT to work on this project was mainly to learn about it and enhance our knowledge. We, furthermore, heard about interesting functionalities that we could find a need for. In addition to that, most of the developers here already knew about programming using web languages. Finally, creating this tool as a website allows easy usage by most users.

# Challenges encountered
Learning and using react has been a new challenge for all of us, but it was, of course, very enriching. We are learning more every day, and thus, be assured that this project will certainly profit from **multiple release adding more interesting features**. The goal is to satisfy our initial client and every potential users needs.
